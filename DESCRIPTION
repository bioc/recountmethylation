Description: Resources for cross-study analyses of public DNAm array data from NCBI GEO repo, produced 
    using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K (HM450K) and MethylationEPIC (EPIC) platforms. 
    Provided functions enable download, summary, and filtering of large compilation files. Vignettes 
    detail background about file formats, example analyses, and more. Note the disclaimer on package 
    load and consult the main manuscripts for further info.
