Description: Access cross-study compilations of DNA methylation array databases. Database files can be downloaded and accessed using provided
    functions. Background about database file types (HDF5 and HDF5-SummarizedExperiment),
    SummarizedExperiment classes, and examples for data handling, validation, and analyses,
    can be found in the package vignettes. Note the disclaimer on package load, and consult
    the main manuscript for further info.
