# Overview

We piped GEO assay and metadata, available as of March 2019, into large data objects for analysis in R sessions. Data files are versioned and timestamped (see filenames).



The `minfi` and `HDF5Array` libraries were used. 



# obtain data

DNAm assay data and metadata are bundled in H5SE objects. 

These can be downloaded fro (url)

(info about h5se objects)

# access data

Use `HDF5Array` to 

H5SE objects were stored using `saveHDF5SummarizedExperiment`

::loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment



# work with data


Use `minfi`
